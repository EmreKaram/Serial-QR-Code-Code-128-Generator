# QR Code & Code 128 Generator

A powerful macOS application built with SwiftUI that allows users to generate high-quality **QR Codes** and **Code 128 barcodes**. Perfect for managing product labels, inventory tracking, or any scenario requiring visually clean and accurate code generation.

## Features

### üõ† Flexible Code Formats  
- **Multiple Code Formats**: Generate either QR codes or Code 128 barcodes.
- **Customizable Range**: Specify a range of numbers to create multiple codes in one go.
- **Text Delimiter**: Add a custom delimiter (e.g., `-`, `_`, `/`) between the product name and the number in the code.
- **White QR Code Option**: Toggle between black and white QR codes.
- **Batch Export**: Codes are exported as PNG files in a dedicated folder within the `Downloads` directory.
- **Text on Barcode**: Displays text below the Code 128 barcodes for added clarity. 

## How to Use
1.	Enter the Product Name in the provided text field.
2.	Specify the Start Number and End Number for the numeric range.
3.	Add a Delimiter (e.g., -, _, /) if desired.
4.	Select the Code Format (QR Code or Code 128).
5.	[Optional] If generating QR codes, toggle the Use White QR Code option to create white codes.
6.	Click the Generate button. The app will:

-	Generate PNG images for each code in the specified range.
-	Automatically open the folder upon completion.

### ‚ö° Batch Generation
